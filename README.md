## Supported Package Managers

The extension automatically detects and uses the available package manager:

| Package Manager | Install Command          | Repositories         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **yay**         | `yay -S package`         | Official repos + AUR |
| **pamac**       | `pamac install package`  | Official repos + AUR |
| **pacman**      | `sudo pacman -S package` | Official repos only  |

## Repository Types

Packages are labeled with their source repository:

- `[core]` - Essential Arch packages
- `[extra]` - Additional official packages
- `[community]` - Community-maintained packages
- `[multilib]` - 32-bit packages
- `[aur]` - Arch User Repository
- `[stable]` - Manjaro stable packages
- `[testing]` - Manjaro testing packages
- `[unstable]` - Manjaro unstable packages

## Configuration

The extension uses the default keyword `pack`. You can change this in Ulauncher preferences:

1. Open Ulauncher preferences
2. Go to "Extensions" tab
3. Find "PackSearch" and click the gear icon
4. Modify the keyword as desired
